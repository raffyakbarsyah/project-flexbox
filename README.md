# üß± Flexbox Landing Page Project (The Odin Project)

This is my solution to the **Flexbox Project Assignment** from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal was to build a landing page using **HTML** and **CSS Flexbox** that closely resembles a provided design.

## üîç Project Overview

This landing page is broken into 4 main sections (plus a footer):

1. **Header / Hero Section**
2. **Features / Info Section**
3. **Quote Section**
4. **Call to Action Section**
5. **Footer**

We were given two reference images:
- **Full Design Layout**
- **Color and Fonts Reference**

The design emphasized layout using **Flexbox**, consistent spacing, and basic styling without focusing on responsive design.

## üí° Key Concepts Practiced

- Structuring semantic HTML
- CSS Flexbox for layout and alignment
- Styling with consistent font sizes and color themes
- Separating concerns between structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS)
- Using `git` best practices like committing early and often!

## üöß How I Approached It

- Started by planning the layout and dividing the site into clear sections
- Added all HTML content first before doing any styling
- Applied CSS one section at a time using a **single stylesheet**
- Referred back to Flexbox exercises for layout help
- Avoided mobile responsiveness (on purpose ‚Äî it comes later in the curriculum)

- ## üß† Lessons Learned

- Flexbox is super powerful when broken down section-by-section
- Planning the HTML first helped reduce frustration while styling
- Writing good commit messages makes reviewing work easier

### üå± Future Improvements

- Make it responsive for mobile devices (in a future lesson!)
- Refactor CSS with reusable classes
- Add interactive elements (like hover effects)
